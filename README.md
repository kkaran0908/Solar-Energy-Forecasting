# Performance of Time Series Models
Time series models are used for univariate analysis of the data, and these model make predictions on the basis of univariate analysis. Solar Energy Forecasting is not a univariate analysis, it depends on various meteorological coditions such as temperature, humidity, etc. So time series model such as AR, MA, ARMA, ARMIA are not performing well as compare to classical machine learning model.
